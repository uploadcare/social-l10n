Social sources localization
===========================

Localization for social sources used in
[Uploadcare](http://uploadcare.com/)
[widget](https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-widget).

Most of the widget's localization is stored in the 
[locale folder](https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-widget/tree/master/app/assets/javascripts/uploadcare/locale).
This part of localization is related to social sources like Dropbox, Instagram,
Facebook and so on, that run on our servers and are opened inside `<iframe>`
element.
